## School_District_Analysis

### Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria, the chief data scientist for the city district, to analyze the information from a variety of sources. This report will help her analyse the data on student funding and standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to get insights on performance trends and patterns. These will help inform discussions and decision at the school and district level. This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decision regarding the school budget and priorities. 

### Results:

#### How is the district summary affected?

1.	The updated district summary does not differ much from the results obtained from the first analysis attempt. The second attempt just makes the overall picture easier to read. 
2.	It helps the reader gain a deeper understanding about the performance of students in the whole districts, the first analysis DataFrame was not formatted properly, which made it hard to understand the true meaning. 

#### How is the school summary affected? 

1.	The updated version contains information about each school’s spending ranges and the school size, which are the two extra columns on the right. This information helps the reader get a better idea about city’s return on investment in terms of increased student performances. 
2.	For instance, from the updated analysis it can be concluded that Thomas High School has the best and highest overall pass percentage in the spending range of $630-$644 per student. 

#### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

1.	Replacing the reading and maths grades for ninth graders helped make the comparison of other students fairer. 
2.	Due to the reports of academic dishonesty, their data was corrupting the analysis.

#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
##### Math and reading scores by grade
Replacing the data helped in refining the data for analysis. It made the analysis fair. From the city’s perspective, the uniform data provides an accurate base data to work on for the future investments. 

##### Scores by school spending
It helped by making a correct image of how the spending is being utilized throughout different schools. Now it is easier to conclude which schools need more funding, and which schools are performing great and will be okay with the same amount or less amount of funding.

##### Scores by school type and school size
The analysis of scores by school type and size are improved by replacing the ninth-grade scores because the academic dishonesty among the ninth graders does not portray a great image among other schools, so eliminating their grades helped them at somewhat maintaining a good status.
